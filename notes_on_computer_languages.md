# My Notes

I wanted to spend a some time talking a bit about programming as a field
and some new thoughts that emerged in relation to the book Elegant JavaScript.

So the first thought is what it is you are doing when you program. The basic 
thought for me was that you are crafting the computational programs that run on the
machine. To put it in non-circular language. You are crafting the what the computer
will due. In a way subjugating the machine so that it does what you want exactly.

The means that you use to do this is a programming language. The programming language
for has a few steps. In essence what the programming language enables you to do is to 
take high level concepts and translates them to the machine code for the computer allowing
you to work much faster then you would have normally have been able to.

Without the aid of the programming language you would be working at the level of machine 
language of 10s and this is very slow and very hard to think and work on. This is also
made more difficult by the fact that you can't really use the help of other developers.
So making any reasonable modern program would take you unreasonably long periods of time.

So we come to the languages that I know which is in essense 3. I know JavaScript very well
and also Python to a much lesser degree. I was working on R and I love R. I do have a hipster
bent so I like things that are off the beaten road for the fact that they are off the road and
under appecerciated.
